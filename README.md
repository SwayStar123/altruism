# Altruism.finance
A capital efficient way to donate to charities

Altruism allows you to deposit SOL and receive altSOL in return which would be pegged 1:1 with SOL.
The peg is maintained by allowing users to mint and burn altSOL in exchange for a proportional amount of SOL that's held
by the protocol. The protocol liquid stakes the SOL that's deposited in the backend, so it's possible for the token to depeg if the
staked validators face slashing. In the case of losses due to validator slashing, donations will be halted till losses are recovered.
If there are no losses and there is a profit from staking, the excess SOL is withdrawn to a donation address
